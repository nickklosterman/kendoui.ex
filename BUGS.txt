FIXED:Instantiating multiple menus on a web page will cause problems. Clicking off the anchored region to close the menu will only work properly for the first menu that was instantiated. The menu instantiated first is the one closest to the beginning of the html document. When there are two instances, the 2nd menu will only be hidden after the 1st menu has been opened and then clicked away from. When a third instance is introduced, the 2nd and 1st instance must be opened and then clicked away from to hide all menus. The 2nd menu will be hidden if the 1st menu is opened and then clicked away from.
